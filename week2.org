* Instructor-led Training Activities
  1. Creation of a BIOS based virtual appliance for a source based server
  2. Learners will be guided through the installation process of Arch Linux
  3. Steps
     1. Create VM with 256RAM and 8Gb HDD
        - 256RAM
        - 8Gb HDD
        - 128 MB Video (Important, failing on this parameter may cause keyboard malfunction)
     2. Start VM and use a recent Arch Linux ISO
     3. Run x86_64 bootable
        1. If a mount error appears (initramfs unpacking failed) please check your ISO
     4. Personal Choice = switch keyboard to dvorak-programmer
        1. ~loadkeys programmer-dvorak~
        2. Or load a latin keyboard
           1. ~es~ when the char *@* is on your *2* key of the main keyboard
           2. ~la-latin1~ when the char *@* is on your *Q* key
     5. Use gparted~ to create partitions
        + Create a label with type msdos
          + ~mklabel msdos~
        + Create a ~swap~ partition after the first ~MiB~ of 512MiB (double of RAM until 4GB)
          + Primar
          + ~linux-swap~
          + ~mkpart primary linux-swap 1MiB 513MiB~
        + Create a ~boot~ partition of 512MB or more
          + Primary
          + ~ext2~
          + ~mkpart primary ext2 513MiB 1025MiB~
        + Use the rest of the disk on another partition
          + Primary
          + ~ext4~
          + ~mkpart primary ext4 1025MiB 100%~
        + Turn on boot flag
          + ~set 2 boot on~
        + Check alignment
          + ~align-check opt 1~
        + If alignment throws an error, erase the table and start again
     6. Format Partitions
        1. ~mkswap /dev/sda1~
        2. ~mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda2~
        3. ~mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4~
        4. When in doubt of partition numbers use ~lsblk~
     7. Mount the virtual drive to the ~/mnt~ partition
        1. ~mount /dev/sda3 /mnt~
        2. ~mkdir /mnt/boot~
        3. ~mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot~
     8. Activate swap space
        1. ~swapon /dev/sda1~
     9. Pull Arch base packages
        1. ~pacstrap /mnt base base-devel~
     10. Prepare file system
         1. ~genstab -U > /mnt/etc/fstab~
     11.
