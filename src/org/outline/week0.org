* Instructor-led Training Activities

1. Exploring the Virtual Box Interface.

   This activity will allow learners to get acquainted with the hypervisor to be
   used on the next activities. This tool will be required for the capstone
   project.

   Students can also use the next resources for extra information.

   - [[https://youtu.be/lUs-lePHb0o][VirtualBox for Virtualization ]][[https://youtu.be/lUs-lePHb0o]]

   - [[https://youtu.be/IlV429snFQw][Virtual Desktops and Servers]] https://youtu.be/IlV429snFQw

2. Install a Simple Linux Application.

   In this activity, the student will install a full Linux distribution targeted
   to desktop environments with the help of Virtualbox.

   Students can also use the next resources for extra information.

   - [[https://youtu.be/oSdchGgZrMM][Installing Linux Mint]] https://youtu.be/oSdchGgZrMM

* Self-pace Learning Activities

1. Watch the following material:

   - [[https://youtu.be/tlI8okaWXVM][Introduction to Windows Server 2012]] https://youtu.be/tlI8okaWXVM

   - [[https://youtu.be/WipM3SAYqK4][Linux Sucks]] https://youtu.be/WipM3SAYqK4

* Assignment: Comparing Operating Systems.

1. Make a /Technical Report/ that compares Operating Systems by identifying the following:
   - Common Operating Systems for severs.
   - Requeriments of each Operating System.
   - Shared services between Operating Systems.
   - Main differences.
   - Documented Risks.
   - Market share of each Operating System according to usage.
2. Include a section with the follwing information:
   - Describe situations where one particular Operating System is better suited
     than others available, commercial or not.
   - Choose a particular business problem that requires a server and write down
     an /Implemetation Task Sheet/ that enumerates the steps required for
     installing the required server including hardware and software requirements.

* Assesment

  1. Grading
	 \begin{equation}
	 grade = \begin{cases}
		 x &\mbox{ if } x \leq 10\mbox{ where }x = \frac{A + 2B + 3C + 4D + 5E}{15} \times 100\\
		 10&\mbox{ otherwise. }
		 \end{cases}
	 \end{equation}
	 \begin{equation}
	 extra = 10\mbox{ if }(D\geq 4\mbox{ or }E\geq 4)\mbox{ and }x = 10.
	 \end{equation}

      | C. Quality of the response. | /Technical Report/ is not fully throught out and complete. Answers are incomplete and do not show evidence of completion of the /Implemetation Task Sheet/. | /Technical Report/ is complete, but the answers are not clearly articulated and fully detailed. Risks are identified, but there is no clear explanation of each one. Minimum answers are provided for each question. | /Technical Report/ is complete and includes an in-dept analysis of the landscape of Operating Systems available. The  proposed scenarios for each Operating Systems are clear and the responses to the questions are well articulated and explained. Responses demostrate a good grasp of how Operating Systems impact the overall performance of business operations. | In-depth analysis of multiple Operating Systems is evident within the /Technical Report/; responses illustrate a deep and thoughtful review. Multiple vulnerabilities are offered and a perspective of its impact. | /Technical Report/ presets and in-depth analysis of the Operating System including academic vews of design. A strong rationale is provided for choosing one Operating System over otherlikes and dislikes of the game actions, design, and appearance; additional factors are also provided for know security risks. |
